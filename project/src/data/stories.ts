    excerpt:
      "The tale of the mysterious lady in white who haunts Balete Drive in Quezon City.",
    content: `Many taxi drivers in Manila avoid Balete Drive at night, especially after midnight. According to the legend, a ghostly woman in white with long dark hair and a pale face appears suddenly in the middle of the road, sometimes in the backseat of the car.

    The story begins in the 1950s with reports of a white-clad woman who would suddenly appear in the middle of Balete Drive. Some say she was a hit-and-run victim seeking justice, while others believe she was a resident of one of the old houses who was brutally murdered.

    The most common version tells of a young woman who was raped and killed by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Her restless spirit is said to wander Balete Drive, appearing to motorists late at night.

    Whether you believe in ghosts or not, many Manila residents still avoid Balete Drive after midnight, just to be safe.`,

    excerpt:
      "How a scorned woman became one of the most feared creatures in Filipino folklore.",
    content: `In the province of Capiz, there lived a beautiful woman named Maria who fell in love with a handsome soldier. The soldier promised to marry her, but he abandoned her when she became pregnant. Humiliated and heartbroken, Maria sought the help of a local witch who gave her a potion that would make the soldier return to her.

    What Maria didn't know was that the potion contained the blood of a demon. After drinking it, she began to transform at night, growing wings and developing a taste for human flesh. She became what locals called an "aswang."

    Her first victim was the soldier who betrayed her. Since then, Maria has been hunting in Capiz, particularly targeting unfaithful lovers. It is said that on dark nights, you can hear the "tik-tik" sound that signals an aswang is nearby, hunting for its next meal.

    To this day, Capiz is known as the "Aswang Capital of the Philippines," and many locals still take precautions against these mythical creatures, especially during the night.`,

    excerpt:
      "The tragic love story behind the longest bridge in the Philippines.",
    content: `The San Juanico Bridge connects the islands of Samar and Leyte in the Philippines. At 2.16 kilometers long, it's the longest bridge in the country. But behind its magnificent structure lies a tragic tale of love and sacrifice.

    According to legend, there was once a powerful goddess named Guibang who fell in love with a mortal fisherman. Their love was forbidden by the god of the sea, who cursed them. The fisherman was turned to stone, becoming part of the island of Samar, while the goddess became Leyte island.

    In her grief, the goddess cried for a hundred years. Her tears formed the San Juanico Strait. Taking pity on the lovers, the other gods created a bridge—the San Juanico Bridge—so that the two could still touch each other despite their transformation.

    Another version of the legend tells of a young woman who drowned herself in the strait after her lover abandoned her. Her ghost is said to haunt the bridge, calling out to passersby, especially men traveling alone at night.

    These stories add a mystical dimension to the bridge, making it not just an engineering marvel but also a testament to enduring love and tragic sacrifice.`,

    title: "The Bakunawa and the Seven Moons",
    excerpt:
      "How a dragon swallowed six of the seven moons in the ancient Filipino sky.",
    content: `In ancient times, according to Filipino mythology, there were seven moons in the sky. They cast a beautiful glow on the earth and made the nights bright and pleasant.

    In the depths of the ocean lived a giant dragon called Bakunawa. One night, it emerged from the sea and was captivated by the beauty of the moons. Filled with desire, it rose from the water and swallowed one of the moons.

    The people on earth were distressed when they saw one of their moons disappear. To stop the Bakunawa from consuming another, they began to make loud noises by beating drums, pans, and gongs. The noise frightened the dragon, which retreated back into the sea.

    However, the Bakunawa's desire for the moons did not diminish. Over time, it returned and managed to swallow five more moons, despite the people's attempts to drive it away.

    Today, only one moon remains in the sky. It is said that during an eclipse, the Bakunawa is attempting to swallow the last moon. That's why in some parts of the Philippines, especially in rural areas, people still make noise during an eclipse, continuing the ancient tradition of trying to drive away the moon-eating dragon.`,

    title: "The Golden Shell of Panay",
    excerpt:
      "A tale of how the island of Panay was created from a magical golden shell.",
    content: `Long ago, when the world was young, the god of the seas held in his possession a magnificent golden shell. This shell was unlike any other - it glowed with an inner light and was said to contain the essence of paradise itself.

    One day, a beautiful sea goddess named Sira fell in love with a mortal fisherman. The god of the seas, jealous of their love, cast the fisherman into the depths. Sira, in her grief, stole the golden shell and shattered it upon the waters.

    As the shell broke, its pieces grew and transformed. The largest piece became the island of Panay, its golden beaches a reminder of its origins. The smaller fragments became the surrounding islands, each containing a portion of the shell's magic.

    The god of the seas, moved by Sira's devotion, transformed the fisherman into the wind that constantly caresses the islands. And so, even today, when the wind blows across Panay's shores, locals say it is the fisherman still embracing his beloved Sira, who became one with the island itself.

    They say that on certain nights, when the moon is full and the tide is high, you can still see a golden glow beneath the waters around Panay, remnants of the magical shell that created this paradise.`,

      "The origin story of one of the Philippines most feared creatures.",
    content: `In a remote village lived a beautiful young woman named Ana, known for her kindness and healing abilities. She learned the art of traditional medicine from her grandmother and used her knowledge to help others. However, her beauty and skills attracted the jealousy of a powerful witch.

    The witch cursed Ana with an insatiable hunger for human flesh and the ability to split her body in half. At night, her torso would separate from her lower body, sprouting wings and a long, proboscis-like tongue. She became the first Manananggal.

    Horrified by what she had become, Ana tried to resist her new nature but eventually succumbed to her cursed hunger. She began hunting at night, particularly targeting pregnant women and unborn children. The curse spread to others who encountered her, creating more Manananggal.

    It is said that Ana still lives, eternally young but forever cursed, and that she weeps for her lost humanity every time she claims a victim. Some say that on rare occasions, she still tries to help people with her healing knowledge, fighting against her dark nature.`,

    content: `Mount Makiling is said to be home to many mystical creatures, but none more powerful than the Tikbalang King. Standing twice the height of a normal man, with the head and hooves of a horse but the body of a human, he is the guardian of the mountain's ancient forests.

    According to legend, the Tikbalang King was once a powerful datu who made a pact with mountain spirits to protect his people from invaders. The spirits granted him immense power, transforming him into a Tikbalang, but at the cost of his human form.

    The Tikbalang King is known for leading travelers astray in the forests of Makiling, creating illusions and endless loops of paths. However, those who show respect for the forest and its creatures might receive his blessing and guidance instead.

    Local elders say that to avoid being tricked by the Tikbalang King, one must wear their clothes inside out and ask permission before entering the forest. Some also claim that if you can manage to pluck a golden hair from his mane, he will grant you a wish.`,

    content: `In the deep forests of Mindanao lives a creature called the Sigbin, resembling a small goat but with peculiar characteristics. It walks backwards with its head between its hind legs and has the ability to become invisible to most humans.

    According to local folklore, the Sigbin belongs to certain families who pass down the creature through generations. These families are said to keep the Sigbin in jars made of clay, releasing them only at night to hunt.

    The Sigbin is believed to bring either great fortune or terrible misfortune. Those who can tame a Sigbin are said to prosper, as the creature can lead them to hidden treasures. However, untamed Sigbin are known to attack travelers and drink their blood through their shadows.

    Some stories tell of the Sigbin's ability to curse those who disrespect it, causing illness and misfortune that can last for generations. The only way to lift such a curse is to gain the forgiveness of the Sigbin's owner family.`,
